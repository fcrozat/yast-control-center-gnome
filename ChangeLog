	Release 2.30.0

	Update code to gnome-control-center 3.6 branch. Most significant change
	is bigger sizes for the window and all icons.

	* configure.in.in: now requires x11
	* src/cut-n-paste/: update code from gnome-control-center
	* src/{control-center.c,gnome-control-center.c,shell.ui}: rebase on updated code
	* src/patch/: update patch to current changes

2012-01-11  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Release 2.21.3

	Update to gnome-control-center code as of today. This reduces our patch
	since many non-yast related changes are upstream now.

	* VERSION: bump version.
	* configure.in.in: we require glib >= 2.31.0
	* src/cut-n-paste/: update code from gnome-control-center.
	* src/{control-center.c,gnome-control-center.c,shell.ui}: rebase on
	updated code.
	* src/patch/: update patch to current changes.

2011-09-02  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Release 2.21.2

	Update to gnome-control-center code as of today. This includes a port
	to new gnome-menus API.

	* VERSION: bump version.
	* configure.in.in: look for libgnome-menu-3.0 instead of libgnome-menu.
	* etc/YaST-gnome.menu: add Layout node to  force the layout we want,
	instead of relying on alphabetical order.
	* src/cut-n-paste/: update code from gnome-control-center.
	* src/{control-center.c,gnome-control-center.c}: rebase on updated code.
	* src/shell-search-renderer.c: tweak this source file to avoid a crash
	caused by the fact that yast .desktop files have no Comment key.
	* src/patch/: update patch to current changes.

2011-07-28  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Release 2.21.1

	Use an internal copy of the libgnome-control-center code since it is
	going private upstream.

	* VERSION: bump version.
	* src/cut-n-paste/libgnome-control-center/: internal copy of the
	libgnome-control-center code.
	* src/cut-n-paste/shell/: copy of the unpatched shell code fro
	gnome-control-center. We build a static library without the code we're
	going to patch. This will make it easier to update to new upstream code
	later on since we'll simply copy the new code there.
	* src/{*.[ch],shell.ui}: simply keep the code we patch here.
	* src/patch/: move gnome-control-center.patch patch there, and add a
	update-patch.sh script to easily update the patch file.

2011-07-25  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Release 2.21.0

	Completely rewrite: this is now a fork of the shell of
	gnome-control-center in GNOME 3. The code should be kept in sync with
	the upstream code; gnome-control-center.patch can be used as a basis for
	this.

	* VERSION: bump version.
	* gnome-control-center.patch: patch that is applied to the
	gnome-control-center shell to get the code in src/.
	* configure.in.in: update dependencies (gconf-2.0, libslab, unique-1.0
	are gone, we now depend on gio-unix-2.0, gtk+-3.0,
	libgnome-control-center, libgnome-menu).
	* etc/yast2-control-center-gnome.schemas.in, etc/Makefile.am: drop gconf
	schema, since we don't use it anymore.
	* src/*: everything is changed.

2010-03-28  Cong Meng <cmeng@novell.com>

    Add a new category High Availability. (bnc #575787)

2009-08-29  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Release 2.13.4
	Note that there'll be no tag in svn, as apparently this module doesn't
	use this. But this commit can be used to identify the release.

	* VERSION: bump version

2009-08-08  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	Synchronize code with code from the shell in gnome-control-center
	(although it's not committed there yet).
	Highlights:
	 - use goption
	 - use unique instead of bonobo
	 - no need for the gconf trick, since we don't use libgnomeui anymore
	 - bigger icons
	 - depends on latest libslab

	* configure.in.in: depends on libslab >= 2.27.1
	* src/Makefile.am: add a few defines
	* src/control-center.c: big changes :-)

2009-08-08  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* etc/yast2-control-center-gnome.schemas.in:
	* src/control-center.c:
	Move the gconf key to /apps/yast-control-center. They should never have
	been in /desktop/gnome/applications/y2cc-gnome

2009-08-08  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* src/control-center.c: (main): use the "current" icon theme for yast,
	instead of NLD.

2009-01-31  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* src/control-center.c: (main): force not using the default handler for
	gconf errors. libgnomeui sets one, and when a program is run under "su"
	(not "su -"), we get gconf errors. And this program is often run under
	"su", it seems :-)

2008-05-12  Michael Meeks  <michael.meeks@novell.com>

	* Version 2.13.3

	* aclocal.m4: remove auto-generated file.

	* src/control-center.c (main): tolerate unknown
	arguments, like '-S' silently: 389069

	* etc/YaST-gnome.menu
	* etc/yast2-control-center-gnome.schemas.in
	* /src/control-center.c:
	Fix for 249717 - change icon
	Fix for 252799 - merge in add on menus
	Use correct .directory names in menu file
	schema back to /desktop prefix - main-menu checks for some of it there.

2007-03-12  Scott Reeves  <sreeves@novell.com>
	* /src/control-center.c:
	Fix for 250415 - allow different theming for the cc shell
	Fix for 249717 - change title to "YaST2 Control Center" - use the same string
	already in yast2-control-center package so we can use existing translations.

2007-02-28  Scott Reeves  <sreeves@novell.com>
	* /etc/YaST-gnome.desktop.in
	* /etc/Makefile.am
	* /etc/yast2-control-center-gnome.schemas.in

	Another attempted fix for 240240
